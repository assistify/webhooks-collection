# Twitter integration

This webhook can help receiving user compaints early and reduce the risk of reputation impact. The incoming web hook
is extremely simple (just a name and an receiving channel is required) and the resulting webhook URL can directly be
used in Twitter when, for example, your twitter name is mentioned.

You can get more information about registering your webhook in Twitter
[here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/accounts-and-users/subscribe-account-activity/guides/managing-webhooks-and-subscriptions).
